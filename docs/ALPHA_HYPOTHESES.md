# Phase A — Alpha Hypotheses (Draft v6)

## Objective

All hypotheses must be:

- Falsifiable
- Quantifiable
- Independently verifiable
- Stress-tested with tail-event scenarios

## Hypotheses

### 1. Profitable Liquidation Opportunities Exist

- EV ≥ minimum actionable threshold (e.g., 0.01 ETH)
- Bootstrap 95% CI
- Tail-event stress included
- Randomized, stratified control positions

### 2. Capture Probability is Non-Zero

- Monte Carlo probability ≥ conservative benchmark (e.g., 3%)
- ≥10 stochastic + adversarial bots
- Tail-event stress
- ≥10 deterministic seeds, independent verification

### 3. Market Conditions Affect EV

- Metrics: collateral ratio, liquidity, volatility, time-of-day
- Stratified regression + multiple hypothesis correction
- Rolling-window backtesting

### 4. Failure Classification is Reproducible

- ≥95% agreement between automated detection and independent verification
- Optional human cross-check for rare anomalies
