# Phase A — Promotion Criteria (Draft v6)

Phase A is **research and validation only**.

## Criteria

1. Hypotheses fully tested:

   - Randomized, stratified controls
   - Rare-event stress scenarios
   - Cross-protocol / multi-chain simulations

2. Reproducibility:

   - Deterministic replay ≥10 seeds
   - Independent verification
   - Hash-chained, versioned, offsite logs

3. Metrics coverage complete

4. Statistical rigor:

   - Bootstrap CIs
   - Minimum sample size
   - Effect size thresholds
   - Multiple hypothesis correction
   - Rolling-window backtesting

5. Safety:

   - SAFE_MODE enforced
   - Testnet/forked execution only
   - Maximum EV capped

6. Uncertainty explicitly communicated

> Only when all criteria are satisfied may Phase B be considered.
